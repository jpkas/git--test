          This is an html-css-javascript web page that I designed just to show what I can do with this technology. I did not use bootstrap.Don't try to find on it the Mobile-First features, even though it is responsive at some extent. Being myself beginner web developer, I would like to encourage those who just began to learn html-CSS-Javascript . At the same time I would like to thank nucamp Bootcamp for the opportunity to code offered to me. <br>The flow of my html work is based on a judicious choice of div(s). A first div contains the h1,h2,h3 elements. A secomd div contains the paragraph of introduction .Then I have created a section containing 4 div(s) to hold two lists and two images. Outside of the section two other div(s) hold a table and a fieldset with form. <br>Without CSS the html page is vertical each element mentioned above following the other without colors nor movement. I like to compare html structure to the human skeleton without flesh. In art,the skeleton evokes the idea of ghost or dead person. It is scary. I mean that html alone is boring. But a human body without skeleton cannot stand. To embelish my html-page, I have created a css-file (index.css) in the same folder where I placed the html-file(index.html) and the two images files. I have chosen class(es) and Id(s) selectors to apply property on the html elements. The class center ,for example ,enabled me to change the html vertical layout into an horintal layout by the mean of the display-flex property. In the same way I applied color and background-color to diffrent parts of the page. Now the page looks like pretty. <br>However it is lacking movement or interactivity. That is why I invited Javascript to help. Instead of creating a Javascript file, I embeded my script in the html placing it before the body's closing tag. The Javascript code inside the script has the power to bring motion to the html-css-page. Of course ,I linked the 4 buttons to the id(s) of each element to be toggled. With the power of javascript addEventListener code the computer is not only able to listen to the click made upon the buttons, but to obey to that prompt. In obedience to the prompt , the computer will make the specified element appear or disappear from the page. So ,by clicking on the buttons one after another you will remove from the page the lists , images and table ; only to leave on it the buttons, the introducting and concluding texts and the form. Vis-versa, you can bring back these elements again just by clicking the same buttons one after another.It is almost magic, isn't ?</p>

            Thank you for visiting this page. Hopefully you have enjoyed the simplicity of the html, the beauty of css and the interactivity of Javascript. Of course , when you look at the page, you will not be able to distinguish the html from css or from Javascript. The page is like the symphony of these three technologies in one piece. The way they work together produce the magic effect .But Html , CSS and Javascript are not mystical things . These are modern web development technologies accessible to everyone from elementary school students, to college and university students and scholars. Everybody can do it .With interest ,search and dedication you can do it too.
    If you are interested, submit y`our credentials in the form below. I will be back to you shortly. My promise to you is that I will recommend you to one of the nucamp embassadors to quench your coding hunger. Or, if you want, I will show you some tricks to help you write your first "Hello World page!" within a week and lead you on the path to master coding. Yes,coding is not about talking but about technology or developing practical skills. You just need to practice and develop new languages different from our ordinary language. As you know ,the Bible says that God created the world with His Eternal WORD.Being God's creatures we too can create with words. By the way, John L. Austin ,a British philosopher of language and leading proponent of ordinary language philosophy wrote a book intitled "How to Do Things With Words".In the same way pastors' words have converted souls and made miracles, in our days web pages and apps have transformed different sectors of human life and set the world on fire. One who has set his hand on coding activity should not look back!Bye! See you soon with a bootstrap page.
